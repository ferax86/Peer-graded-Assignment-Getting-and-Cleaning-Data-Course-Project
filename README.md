The Dataset took in consideration is the  "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones"
## Files included in the repository 
In additon to this file there are the following objects in this repository:

 2-Run_Analysis.R : the script performs the 5 steps required 
 
 3-CleanDataSet.txt : the final tidy dataset obtained after having performed the 5 questions required
