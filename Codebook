##This codebook explain the all the procedures (initial set up , variables and dataframes creation, data manipulation) I created in order to perform the 5 tasks assigned for this project   .
# 1.	Download the dataset
      o	Dataset downloaded and extracted under the folder called UCI HAR Dataset
      o	For simplicity I put all datasets in the same folder to load at the same time the files in R 

2.	Dataframe creation
I load the following files and assign them to the following dataframes:
o	features <- features.txt 
o	Activities <- activity_labels.txt 
o	Subject_test <- subject_test.txt 
o	Subject_train <- test/subject_train.txt 
o	Test_set <- X_test.txt
o	Training_set<- X_train.txt
o	Activity_train<- y_train.txt
o	Activity_test<-y_test.txt

3.	Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set
I created three datasets (A,B,C):
1.	Dataset A is created by merging “Subject_train” and “Subject_test“datasets  by row (rbind)
2.	Dataset B is created by merging “Activity_train” and “Activity_test “datasets   by row (rbind)
3.	Dataset C is created by merging “Training_set” and “Test_set “datasets   by row (rbind)

Finally I merge them by column (cbind) in a big dataset called dataset1 

4.	Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement

o	Dataset2 is created by subsetting dataset1, selecting only columns: subject, code and the measurements on the mean and standard deviation (std) for each measurement

5.	Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
o	The label code in code column of the Dataset2 have been replaced with corresponding code activity taken from second column of the Activities datasets

6.	Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names
o	code column in dataset2 renamed into activities
o	All Acc in column’s name replaced by Accelerometer
o	All Gyro in column’s name replaced by Gyroscope
o	All BodyBody in column’s name replaced by Body
o	All Mag in column’s name replaced by Magnitude
o	All start with character f in column’s name replaced by Frequency
o	All start with character t in column’s name replaced by Time
o	All dots have been deleted 

7.	From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
o	CleanDataSet is created by grouped by subject and activity the dataset2 and calculating the means of each variable for each activity and each subject

8.	Finally, I Export CleanDataSet into CleanDataSet.txt file.
